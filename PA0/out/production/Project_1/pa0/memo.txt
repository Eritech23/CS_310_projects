Q1. Writting this program was good because I managed to revised data structure, especially maps and trees.I'm not a fan of IDE. I do prefer text editor such as sublime. But, to code in Java I use IntelliJ. Also I use Macos which is Unix based, as my main OS. To point out I have dual boot with Windows, in case I need it. 



Q2. In the ReportLine Complexity run time line by line should be linear O(n) for each user entry. Since, I loaded the log file in a array list first. However, I did use maps to find maxUsage so the complexity would be O(1) for insertion and look up. And finally to generate Report I did use a Tree Map to storage and sort the data with complexity of  O(logN) for insertion and look up. And worst case would be O(nlogn) since I used hashmap and tree to search in a array list-Not sure if I'm right with this assumption.
